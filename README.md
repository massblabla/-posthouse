# posthouse
### version 1.0.0
**created by massblabla**
A site that I use to post something that is not videos.

## How can I use it?
Just fork it, modify something, which is:
* *.html
* *.js
* posts/*
Want to change the theme, go to styles/*.css  
Literally all the files, but, I use this.

## Contribute?
